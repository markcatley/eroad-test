# EROAD Test

This is my go at the test for EROAD interview process.

Please bare in mind that:
 - Java is not my forte. My professional java experience is very old, so
   I could very well be missing some java idioms/best practices.
 - I never got a brief for this, just copied some examples that were on
   github. I am sorry if I've missed something.
 - I did this before considering that I would be actually submitting it
   so I have used java features for the sake of it and for my own
   enjoyment.
 - The testing and error handing is not great, and definitely not what
   I would do on production code. I didn't see the value in investing
   the time in proper mocking/stubbing and architecting the code for
   optimum testability.

Thanks for looking at this and I hope I don't frighten you off.
